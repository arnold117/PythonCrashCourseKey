Make a dictionary called favorite_places.
Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person.
To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places.
Loop through the dictionary, and print each person’s name and their favorite places.
